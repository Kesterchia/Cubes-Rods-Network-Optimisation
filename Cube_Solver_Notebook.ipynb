    "If such rods exist, remove those rods and save the number of rods removed under \"r\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If the condition is not met, the rod cannot be cut. If it is met, then the rod can be cut and some platinum is earned!!$$$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: After choosing to cut or not cut the rod, the algorithm continues iterating through each rod in the network until every rod has been considered. The function then returns the total number of rods cut (remembering to include the cutting of the duplicate rods in the beginning). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence of rod consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses a sequential selection of rods to consider (i.e. algorithm considers one rod, then the next, then the next). As the cutting of the rods affects the entire network, the order in which the rods are considered by the algorithm affects whether the optimal solution is obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in the compute function, the algorithm is run for 5000 random permutations of the rod sequence, outputting a solution each time. The maximum of all 5000 solutions will be returned as the optimal solution (as we want to cut as many rods as possible). \n",
